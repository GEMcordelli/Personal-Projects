'And

the
rhythm
like
Marvin

Luther'
I
can
tell
you
ain't
no
messing
with
Kan-man
and
Twist
'From
the
Chi
and
I
be'
'Sipping
Hennessy'
'Play

R&B'
'While

a
G?
'And

'Come

Champagne'
You

Whispers
'Hit

stop
light
move
it
to
some
Isleys'
'The
rims
still
moving
so
I
bump
a
little
Spinners'
While
I'm
smoking
on
a
B
'Dipping
through
the
streets'
'Bumping
R&B'
'And
I
got
the
heat
on
the
23s?'
'And
I
do
it
(well
well
well
well
well)'
'With
my
Earth
and
the
Wind
smoke
a
Fire'
'Let
me
get
your
sheets
wet
listening
to
Keith
Sweat'
'Put

a
daze
with
Maze'
'Fulfilling
our
every
temptation

jamming
having
deep
sex'
'You

Come

I'm
loving

to
Jodeci
'And
when
I

ass'
'You

bumping
Teddy
Pendergrass'
I'd
hit
it
from
the
back
to
the
melody
and
rode
it
slow
Now
I
gotta
go
up
in
it
fast
but
I'm
'a
finish
last
'No

how
much
of
a
thug
you

I
still
spit
it
like
it's
R&B
come
to
the
club
with
me
'And

I
hope

'Hello
everyone
this
is
your
action
news
reporter
with
all
the
news
that
is
news
across
the
nation
on
the
scene
at
the
supermarket.'
'Yeah
I
did.'
I's
standin'
overe
there
by
the
tomaters
and
here
he
come
running
through
the
pole
beans
through
the
fruits
and
vegetables
nekkid
as
a
jay
bird.
'And
I
hollered
over
t
'
Ethel
I
said
Don
't
look
Ethel!
'
But
it's
too
late
she'd
already
been
incensed.
'Here
he
comes
look
at
that
look
at
that'
'There
he
goes
look
at
that
look
at
that'
And
he
ain't
wearin'
no
clothes
'(Look
at
that
look
at
that)'
'Of
his
anatomy'
Invitin'
public
critique
'Yeah
I
did.'
I's
just
in
here
gettin
my
car
checked
he
just
appeared
out
of
the
traffic.
Come
streakin'
around
the
grease
rack
there
didn't
have
nothin'
on
but
a
smile.
I
looked
in
there
and
Ethel
was
gettin'
her
a
cold
drink.
She'd
already
been
mooned.
'Flashed
her
right
there
in
front
of
the
shock
absorbers.'
He
ain't
crude
look
at
that
look
at
that
He
ain't
lewd
look
at
that
look
at
that
'(Look
at
that
look
at
that)'
'(Look
at
that
look
at
that)'
He's
always
makin'
the
news
Wearin'
just
his
tennis
shoes
'Guess
you
could
call
him
unique'
'Yeah
I
did.'
Half
time
I's
just
goin'
down
thar
to
get
Ethel
a
snow
cone.
'And
here
he
come
right
out
of
the
cheap
seats
dribbling
right
down
the
middle
of
the
court.'
Didn't
have
on
nothing
but
his
PF's.
'Made
a
hook
shot
and
got
out
through
the
concessions
stand.'
'But
it
was
too
late.'
She'd
already
got
a
free
shot.
'(Look
at
that
look
at
that)'
'Of
his
anatomy'
He's
gonna
give
us
a
peek
'Here
he
comes
again.'
Who's
that
with
him?
'Ethel?'
'Is
that
you
Ethel?'
What
do
you
think
you're
doin'?
'You
git
your'
Where
you
goin'?
'Ethel
you
shameless'
'hussy!'
'Ethel!'
'Ethelllllll!!'
'!'
Pardon
me
sir
did
you
see
what
happened?
Yeah
I
did.
He's
just
as
proud
as
he
can
be
Of
his
anatomy
He
likes
to
show
off
his
physique
If
there's
an
audience
to
be
found
He'll
be
streakin'
around
Invitin'
public
critique
But
it
was
too
late.
Ethel!
