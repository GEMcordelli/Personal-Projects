Baby I can't figure it out,
Your kiss is just like honey.



You can't deny what you feel for me,
Baby, baby, baby, baby.
See love comes once so let's take it babe,
Baby, baby.


Come here boy
Woah, baby, girlfriend check it out
Hey-hey-hey, shape up girls

A cross between a movie star, and a hero in a book
Romeo comes struttin' in, and everybody looks
'Cause he's just got that special thing that everybody needs
And everybody wants him, but not as bad as me

Hey, Romeo, where art thou? Get out here on the floor
I want to dance you darlin', 'til you forget therefore
Let's two step to a new step, we'll keep it all in line
And we'll call this the Romeo, cause you're so mighty fine, oh

Romeo, Romeo, Romeo come dance with me

And that sexy little body beats all I've ever seen
I ain't never seen a cowboy look that good in jeans
My temperature keeps risin' every time we meet
I may not be in love, but let me tell you, I'm in heat

Romeo, Romeo, (He is hot) I just know I'll get you yet
Romeo, Romeo, I want to be your Juliet
(Here he comes)

So step it high, and step it low, step it out and in
Step to the side and let it slide, then step it up again
Step on toes, it all goes, steppin' as you please
But I'm one step away from love, so don't step out on me

Romeo, Romeo, Romeo with the magic feet
Wooh, oh my, hey girls
Ch-ch-ch-ch-check it out
Get back

So step it high, and step it low, step it out and in
Step to the side and let it slide, then step it up again (Nice)
Step on toes, it all goes, steppin' as you please
But I'm one step away from love, so don't step out on me

(Romeo, Romeo)
I just know I'll get you yet
(Romeo, Romeo)
Won't you be my Juliet (uh-huh)
(Romeo, Romeo)
Oh look at that sexy thing, right there
Don't look
(Romeo, Romeo)
He is a sexy little thing, isn't he?
What kinda jeans are those anyway?
I tell you what, I didn't meet as far as his eyes, did you?
(Romeo, Romeo)
Actually, no I didn't (ha-ha-ha)
Shakespeare would roll over in his grave
Uhh, I'm old enough to be that boys lover
(Romeo, oh Romeo)
Oh, I'm in shock
Wish I had a swing like that in my backyard
(Romeo, Romeo)
Oh man
I'm gonna give you that rope there and let you hang us all
(Romeo, Romeo)
With the magic what?
Magic feet!
