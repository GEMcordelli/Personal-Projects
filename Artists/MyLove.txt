Ain't another woman that can take your spot my-

If I wrote you a symphony,
Just to say how much you mean to me
What would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular
Tell me, would you?

Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl
Like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
Saying "I do"

Yeah, because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Girl
My love
My love

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote
What would you do?
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team
Tell me, would you?

See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure
That baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for
Just saying "I do"

Yeah, because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Girl
My love
My love

Alright it's time to get it JT
I don't know what she hesitates for man
Shorty, cool as a fan
On the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls real wild
Throw their hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And with friends so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I.
They call me Candle Guy (why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try
You don't come, I ain't gon' die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go? Why?
Me and your boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high? Man
Well, baby it's obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla anywhere I chill
Just bring with me any pair, I will

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Girl
