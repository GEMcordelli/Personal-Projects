From our EDA: Want to zero in on differences in song subject based on factors like gender of the artist, and how high the artist ranked over theri net carerr on the BB Top 100. 

  Anthroplogical/Social Psychological Lens: what kind of trends do we see in the types of songs that get popular? What does this say about the artist? What does this say about the audience? Why might certain gender substitutes be popular (baby,
you, thing, etc.) and why?

  Applied: how can we use these patterns to guide and predict future song creation and gage levels of popularity, and therefore be able to predict and leverage potential profits for artists, producers, concert venues,
etc.


Palomba Script: I've selected one of the song data points for further explortion by loading it in and parsing the text. I want to compare across similar genres and time periods,
with differing artist genders and see the stylistic change and similarities, and how these relate to song popularity
